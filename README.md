# MinimalDebugger
## Authors: Eli Salm, Zoe Grubbs, Mujtaba Aslam

A minimal deubgger that catches segmentation faults and provides useful information to help the user debug them. The debugger also provides an option to set a breakpoint before the prgram is executed.  

Usage:
`./gdb ./[program]` where program is the program to be debugged. For example, run `make` in the src directory and then `./gdb ./seg`
